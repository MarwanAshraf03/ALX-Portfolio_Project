infrastructure:
  - backend:
      - containerized backend, frontend, and database (using Docker)
      - use Mosquitto MQTT for bid notifications and auction updates
      - use WebSocket or other real-time communication protocols for updates
      - utilize a load balancer for high availability and scalability
      - ensure persistent data storage for auctions and bids in MongoDB
      - implement secure and efficient message broker architecture for low-latency updates
      - integrate backup strategies for the database and auction data
      - automate system scaling to handle increasing traffic and user base

security:
  - backend:
      - implement TLS-secured connections for all communication (MQTT, HTTP, etc.)
      - ensure bid verification mechanisms to prevent tampering
      - secure user and admin accounts (password hashing, MFA)
      - implement access control and authorization (role-based permissions)
      - protect sensitive user data (encryption at rest and in transit)
      - monitor for suspicious activity (fraud detection, bid manipulation)

admin:
  - backend:
      - create auctions
      - add auction data (image-url, starting-price, start-date, end-date)
      - manage users (ban/unban, assign roles)
      - monitor system health (database, server, bid activity)
      - manage notifications (set alerts for upcoming auctions, bidding activity)
      - configure auction settings (auction duration, starting price, etc.)
      - view and generate platform usage reports (auction statistics, user activity)
      - manage payment integration (if applicable)
      - manage backup and disaster recovery plans

user:
  - backend:
      - engage in an auction
      - place bids in real-time
      - view auction details (item, price, bid history)
      - receive notifications on bid status, auction updates, outbid alerts
      - have a secure account (authentication, profile management)
      - view auction analytics (for individual auctions and general trends)
      - participate in bidding war prevention (e.g., bid-sniping prevention mechanisms)
      - make payments (if applicable, based on auction items)

system:
  - backend:
      - manage real-time auction and bid updates (via Mosquitto MQTT or WebSocket)
      - store auction and bid data securely in MongoDB
      - ensure platform security (authentication, authorization, TLS encryption)
      - monitor and log system performance (CPU, memory, disk usage)
      - provide disaster recovery and backup mechanisms for auction data
      - scale the platform based on load (using Docker, Kubernetes, or load balancers)
      - handle message queueing (for bid updates, auction status, etc.)
      - provide data integrity checks and audit trails for all transactions and admin activities
      - ensure platform availability (handle traffic spikes, prevent downtime)

notifications:
  - backend:
      - push notifications for bid updates and auction statuses
      - email notifications for auction reminders, outbid alerts, and auction results
      - admin alerts for unusual system activities (e.g., failed payments, system errors)
      - auction alerts for when an auction is ending or has been outbid

third-party-integrations:
  - backend:
      - optional social media login (Google, Facebook, etc.)
      - payment gateway integration (for auction purchases)
      - shipping and logistics integration (for physical goods auctions)
      - analytics integration (Google Analytics, etc.) for tracking user behavior and platform performance

user-experience-enhancements:
  - backend:
      - real-time auction updates (bid notifications, auction end countdown)
      - anti-sniping mechanisms (auction time extension when bids are placed at the last moment)
      - auction filtering by category, price, and time remaining
      - personalized user dashboard (bidding history, favorite items)
